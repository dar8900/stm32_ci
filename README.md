# STM32 Embedded Development Project with CMake
This project provides a development environment for STM32-based embedded applications using the powerful CMake library by ObKo.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- STM32 microcontroller board
- Toolchain for STM32 development (e.g., GCC Arm Embedded)
	* For **debian** based distro, install with `sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi`
	* For **arch linux** based distro, install with `sudo pacman -Sy arm-none-eabi-gcc`, or with **yay**: `yay -Sy arm-none-eabi-gcc`. Maybe you have to install eather `arm-none-eabi-gcc-newlib`
- CMake (version 3.20 or higher)
- ObKo's CMake library (included as a submodule in this repository)
- STCube Hal and CMSIS firmware git repo (automatic cloning after updating configuration file)
- You have to install **docker** and [scuba](https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/scuba)  if you want to build the binary file inside a container

## Getting Started
To begin using this project, follow these steps:
- Write your configuration file **build_conf.conf** using the template file under the **template** dir
- Launch the build with the script **launch_cmake.sh** adding the type of your build <debug or release> (default __debug__)

### Scuba and docker users
If you want to use [scuba](https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/scuba) to build the program, the **Dockerfile** for building the image and the configuration file for scuba (**.scuba.yml**) is attached in the repository.
To start the build type 
``` bash
scuba build <conf file.conf> [clean]
```

## Customization
This project is structured to provide a basic template for STM32 development. You can customize it to fit your specific requirements:
- Add STCube git repo in **build_conf.conf** for your application using your stm family.
- Modify the CMakeLists.txt file to include additional source files, libraries, or configuration settings.
- Add your source code files to the src directory.
- Adjust the project-specific settings
	* Add your `stm32<family>xx_hal_conf.h` under **inc** folder
	* Add your `stm32<family>xx_it.h` under **inc** folder and your `stm32<family>xx_it.c` under **src** folder
	* In `main.h` add the `#include <stm32<family>xx_hal.h>` for your application

## Debugging
To debug the project, install **openocd** and run it with two options. 
These two options vary according to the type of debugger in use and according to the STM32 platform being used.
An example of a command could be:
- `openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f1x.cfg` (for users who installed openocd on linux)
Openocd will start a session on localhost on port 3333 to which we will have to connect with gdb.
Now start **gdb-multiarch** giving it the project's **elf**.
Once started type the command:
- `target extended-remote localhost:3333`
and gdb will connect to openocd and you can start debugging.
